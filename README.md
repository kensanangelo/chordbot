# Chord Progression Generator Twitter Bot (Chordbot)
This is a node.js bot that automatically generates chord progressions, to be tweeted once per day.

**Node.js is required to run this program.**

- chordprogression.js has the variable env="dev" for a development environment. This prints the output to the command line instead of attempting to connect to Twitter. Before submitting changes, please ensure that it is still set to dev for ease of use.

- Also included is twitKey-template.js. It contains the area for adding Twitter API information. If you plan on using it in production, change the filename to twitKey.js.

If you plan on using any of this on your own project, please provide credit and a link back to https://github.com/kensanangelo/chordbot

*The twitter api key has been kept on a seperate ignored file for security reasons.*
